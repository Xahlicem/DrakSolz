Drak Solz is a mod that changes a lot of in-game mechanics. Or how you usually play the game anyway. Dying? Yeah, that'll happen a lot... But beware, if you die you will definitely pay the price!

Main adjustments:
Early-Game is MUCH harder, but only if you manage to die. As long as you play carefully then you won't notice too much of a difference, outside of your huge damage reduction that you start with.
Scaling stats allow you to grow and become stronger for late-game enemies, as well as choose a specific build for your character.
Hollow buff is gaind from taking damage and upon death, to really set home your punishment for failing, but can be removed through varius ways.
Souls allow you to level up stats or craft exclusive powerful items, and are gained by killing enemies, but will always drop upon your death.
Minion/Summon is changed into Miracle Damage, with special miracle spells.
Throwing is now a class, with a unique celestial pillar to supply end-game throwing armor.
